# Introduction to Constain

As humanity became a Type II civilization, we reached the pinnacle of our power, but we are not done yet. A race of cave dwellers and hunter-gatherers establishing dominance over the solar system goes to show the potential of mankind. However, this potential has been questioned by a foreign entity threatening our existence. Mankind is at war with a Type III civilization. This has led to an acute shortage of resources, with all focus being diverted into the war, life has become tough for the ordinary citizen. Also with excessive pollution and climate change on planet earth, basic essentials like clean water and oxygen are no longer available in the environment. It is impossible to move outdoors without oxygen kits.

Constain is an app supported directly by the government, in times of shortage and famine, Constain works with governmental organizations to ration life-sustaining resources to the average citizen. Unfortunately due to the scenario, a consumer can only get what is allotted to them on the basis of height,  weight, age and sex. These measures have been taken to minimise wastage of essential resources. Rationing of essential materials has been an age-old practice during wartime, however, the proportions decided by us are more than enough for any consumer. BMI is also used as a parameter for deciding the amount of resources to be available to the consumer. 

The user after opening the app can log in or create an account on Constain, after which they can place orders for their rations, as of now, nutrition packages, water packages and oxygen kits are available on the app. After order placement, high tech delivery drones deliver the order within the same day. 

The central goal of Constain is to ensure the survival of humanity during a trying time while also managing to save essential resources.
